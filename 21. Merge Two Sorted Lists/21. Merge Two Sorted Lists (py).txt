QUESTION:
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

SOLUTION:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, a, b):
        if a and b:
            if a.val > b.val:
                a, b = b, a
            a.next = self.mergeTwoLists(a.next, b)
        return a or b
